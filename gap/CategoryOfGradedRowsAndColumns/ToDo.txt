TODO:

Logic needed?

(*) Check implementations of weak kernel embedding and weak cokernel projection
(*) Implement ProjectionInBiasedWeakFibreProduct
(*) Implement InjectionOfBiasedWeakPushout
(*) Implement IsLiftable and IsColiftable
(*) In case the underlying ring is commutative, the non-graded counter-part has special methods
-> implement these functions also for this graded counterpart

Test BiasedWeakFiberProduct and UniversalMorphismIntoBiasedWeakFiberProduct for category of graded rows and columns

Remove "left" and "right" remnants in Tools.gd and Tools.gi
