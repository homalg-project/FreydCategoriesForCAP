@Martin:

(*) Brutally, make PresentationsByProjectiveGradedModules work
-> Tests work and we can use these to test the implementation
-> Implement the necessary methods into FreydCategory and send Sepp pull requests for each of these

(*) Alternatively:
Compare the installed methods in PresentationCategory( GradedRows ) and FreydCategory( GradedRows )

(*) Perform basic integration of PresentationByGradedRows into Freyd

@Sepp:

(*) Have a look at 
     https://github.com/HereAround/TruncationsOfPresentationsByProjectiveGradedModules
    and
     https://github.com/HereAround/SheafCohomologyOnToricVarieties/blob/master/gap/DegreeXLayer.gd
=> Develop idea on how to implement Homomorphism-Structure provided the truncations (of the involved graded rows/columns) are finite dimensional vector spaces

(*) Implement InternalHom and Tensorproduct for category of rows

(*) Review Category of columns and implement InternalHom and Tensorproduct also there


@Both:

(*) Think of a NICE name for Freyd( GradedRow ) since GradedModulesForCAP is already taken.
    Also "PresentationByProjectiveGradedModules" is fairly long... I am not too much in favour of it...
