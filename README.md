# FreydCategoriesForCAP

A package for various universal constructions mostly in an Ab-enriched context.

This package includes implementations (amongst others) of:
- [Freyd categories](#freyd-categories)
- [Cokernel image closures](#cokernel-image-closures)
- [Adelman categories](#adelman-categories)

## Freyd categories

Freyd categories provide a universal way of equipping a given additive category with cokernels. They can be identified with categories of finitely presented functors.

## Cokernel image closures

Given an additive category, closing its category of finitely presented functors under images in the big category of all additive functors can be made constructive.

## Adelman categories

Adelman categories provide a universal way of turning an additive category into an abelian category.
